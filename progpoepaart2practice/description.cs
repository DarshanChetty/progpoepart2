 * After thoroughly reviewing the project, it became evident that there were several issues that needed to be addressed. 
 * The design aspect of the project was considered basic, with some remaining bugs. The project build frequently crashed, and it was necessary to change my code to fix these errors. 
 * The usage of arrays seemed appropriate, but the classes employed were poorly named. 
 * An attempt was made to implement scaling functionality; however, it lacked the crucial feature of allowing users to select units. 
 * The control provided by the menu was also subpar. Though attempts were made to incorporate reset functionality, it was not fully functional; however i have fixed it and made it function. 
 * Comments were added sporadically throughout the code, and there was a fair understanding and display of coding standards.

To rectify these issues, I took a systematic approach. First and foremost, I focused on the design aspect and tackled the remaining bugs. 
By thoroughly analyzing the code and addressing the reported errors, I was able to stabilize the project build, ensuring it no longer crashes unexpectedly.

Next, I tackled the issue of poorly named classes. I carefully reviewed the purpose and functionality of each class and renamed them appropriately to enhance code readability and maintainability.

To address the scaling functionality, I reworked the code to include a user-friendly unit selection feature. Users can now choose the desired units for scaling, providing them with greater control and flexibility.

The menu control was improved by implementing a more intuitive and responsive interface. I enhanced the user experience by redesigning the menu system, ensuring smoother navigation and more straightforward access to features.

To enhance the reset functionality, I carefully examined the existing code and identified the areas where it fell short. By implementing the necessary changes and conducting rigorous testing, 
I ensured that the reset functionality was fully functional and capable of restoring the project to its initial state reliably.

To improve code documentation, I thoroughly reviewed the comments and added missing ones where necessary. 
This enhanced the code's readability and made it easier for others to understand its structure and functionality.

In addition to addressing the reported issues, I took the initiative to implement exception handling and refine string manipulation throughout the code. 
This ensured a more robust and reliable program overall.

Moreover, I revamped the readme file to meet the requirements. 
I provided a clear and concise project description, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and a brief explanation of the code structure. Additionally, I added proper code attribution to acknowledge any external sources utilized in the project.

Throughout the process, I maintained a well-organized GitHub repository to track all the changes made. 
This ensured transparency and allowed me to easily go back to the previous versions if i made an error in the new version, which saved time as i did not have to restart the whole code to find an error which was not able to be found,instead i could go back to the previous version and implement changes from there.

In conclusion, by diligently addressing the reported errors and taking proactive steps to enhance various aspects of the project, 
I successfully transformed it into a more stable, user-friendly, and well-documented application. The issues with design, bugs, class names, scaling functionality, menu control, resets, comments, coding standards, readme file, exception handling, and string manipulation were all effectively resolved, resulting in an improved and more reliable codebase.
